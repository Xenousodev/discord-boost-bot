	* First make sure you have your bot token and everything need for this, turn on developer mode in your discord client if you havent already.
	  (You can get your bot token from https://discord.com/developers/applications)

	* Replace your bot token, guild id & your own id inside settings.json

	* Type https://capmonster.cloud in your browser and create a new account (this is for solving captchas, you MUST have money on the account for your key  to work.)
